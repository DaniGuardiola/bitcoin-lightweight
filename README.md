# bitcoin-lightweight

A friendly lightweight Bitcoin wallet, using electrumx servers as backend and with a complete set of features:

-   BIP49 key derivation, with external and change addresses
-   BIP39 seed (mnemonic phrase) generation or import with optional passphrase
-   Real time events:
    -   New incoming or outgoing transactions for all addresses
    -   Transaction status change on the blockchain (unconfirmed / inputs confirmed / confirmed)
    -   New blocks
-   Automatic SPV
-   Automatic transaction composition, signing and broadcasting
-   Storage-friendly: a normalized way to save and restore the state of the JavaScript class to load your app or service fast

# Usage

```js
import Wallet from 'bitcoin-lightweight'

const wallet = new Wallet(
  'bitcoin_electrum_bip39',                     // wallet type
  'chair window sun guitar piano sky brick',    // secret
  { network: 'testnet' })                       // options

const app = async () {
  await wallet.ready()                          // wait for 100% load

  const bitcoinBalance = wallet.getBalance()    // obtain wallet balance in bitcoin
  console.log()

  const euroBalance = wallet.getBalance('EUR')  // obtain balance in euro

  const txFilter = {
    before: timestamp,                  // block timestamp
    after: timestamp,                   // block timestamp
    from: [<addresses>],                // list of addresses
    to: [<addresses>],                  // list of addresses
    direction: 'out' / 'in',            // direction of the transfer
    min: <amount of bitcoin>,           // amount of bitcoin transferred
    max: <amount of bitcoin>,           // amount of bitcoin transferred
    description: <substring or regex>   // description text search
  }

  const txs = wallet.getTransactions(   // obtain transactions
    txFilter,                           // transaction filter
    10,                                 // items per page
    3)                                  // page number

  wallet.send(10, <address>)            // send someone bitcoin

  wallet.receive()                      // get last unused address
}

app()
```

> Note: keep in mind that wallet is refered to at times as the collection of addresses and their private keys that hold the ownership of the Bitcoins (not the wallet software itself). 

Two types of Bitcoin electrum wallets are supported:

### Types of wallet

-   BIP39 (mnemonic)

> [BIP-0039 spec](github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki)

Generated from a "seed" phrase comformed of multiple words separated by spaces, making it friendly and easier to remember than a standard private key. Generates a BIP32 HD key (read below).

ID: `bitcoin_electrum_BIP39_BIP49`
Secret: 

-   BIP-32 (Hierarchical Deterministic key)

> [BIP-0032 spec](github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)

Generated from a private HD key. A Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key is a seed that can be derived into multiple sub-keys or addresses. BIP39 phrases are converted to BIP32 seeds.

The derivation path is BIP49 with addresses only from default account at index 0. Addresses are P2SH(P2WPKH) or Pay To Witness (segwit) Public Key Hash wrapped in Pay To Script Hash.

> [BIP-0049 spec](github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-004.mediawiki)

ID: `bitcoin_electrum_BIP49`

## main

Abstracts the logic of wallets, supporting multiple types for multiple currencies.

**Parameters**

-   `type` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Type of wallet
-   `secret` **([string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) \| [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object))** Private information that provides full access to the wallet

### onReady

Resolves once wallet is up-to-date and ready to be used (or immediately if that's already the current state)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)** Resolves only once ready

### getAddresses

Returns **{external: [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;{id: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), balance: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)}>, change: [array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;{id: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String), balance: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)}>}** Addresses and their current balances

### getBalance

Retrieves the current wallet balance and the estimation for the secondary currency

**Parameters**

-   `options` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** Options for the getBalance operation (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `options.secondaryCurrency` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Overwrites the secondary currency setting
    -   `options.withSymbol` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Returns strings with the currency symbol appended instead of just numbers for balances

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;{balance: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number), secondary: {balance: [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number), currency: [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)}}>** Object that contains the balance of the wallet currency and the secondary currency information
